Migrating everything over from old domains, more to come soon.  We are splitting into two unique ventures:

1) Dot Org:  Non profit focused on health data security and privacy literatcy.  Helping patients, payers and providers critically validate the apps they use in the wearable and mobile health enviroment.  

2) Dot Com:  Technology solutions focused on applying analytics to individual patient expereince.  First venture is focused on GoogleGlass applications for the diabetic community, specifically around wound care treatment and amputation prevention. 

More to come.  I know this is ugly as sin.  Questions, comments, spelling corrections email me at hello@laurencstill.com
